## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Pytorch
* Numpy
* Opacus(for some files)
* scipy
* PIL


### Executing programs

* All experiments and files can be run indepedently, either locally or though a service like colab
* for experiements that Involve transformed data, download the data and load through its path
* Training results will save as Numpy files, which can then be loaded as comparison
